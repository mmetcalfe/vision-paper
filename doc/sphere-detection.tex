	\begin{abstract}
		Many recent approaches to ball detection in robot soccer reduce the task to edge circle detection, or by training a classifier to detect specific balls with known colour or surface texture. In the present work,
		a more general approach to ball detection
		is investigated,
		where spherical 3D objects must be detected under unknown lighting, colouring and texturing. Pilot experiments applied techniques stemming from the face detection literature, namely boosted-classifiers using extended Haar features, Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HoG), and Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) as features.
		%A controlled experiment was performed to test the hypothesis that training a classifier for sphere detection would produce a more robust ball detector. In particular, that including
		Disk-like objects were included as negative samples in the training set in order to produce a detector that does not misclassify circular, disk-like objects as 3-dimensional balls.
		%Pilot results suggest that extended Haar features are more suited to the task than LBPs.
		The resulting classifiers were able to detect homogeneously or moderately textured balls while robust detection of balls with unknown strong patterns still remains a challenge. %However, further experiments would be required to confirm these results.


		% \todo{discuss results here}

		% We hypothesised that this approach will produce a more robust ball detector. In particular, a detector that does not mis-classify circular, disk-like objects as spheres.


		% We present preliminary results on applying Haar cascade classifiers to the problem, which indicate that classifier performance is extremely sensitive to the training data and settings used.

	\section{Introduction} {
	\label{sec:intro}
Central to the game of football or soccer is the task of detecting and tracking the ball. While	two competing teams interact in gaining control over the ball on the field there is also a large crowd of emotional spectators that all try to solve the question ``Where is the ball?" and to follow it visually. While it appears to come naturally to humans, fast and reliable ball detection has presented a significant challenge that has attracted much research, for example, in the robot soccer community~\cite{KitanoEtAl1997}.


%	\section{Related Work} {
%	\label{sec:related_work}

		%Visually keeping track of a ball is a natural and fundamental aspect of playing soccer, that many human players would not consider to be a skill in itself.


		Early attempts at ball detection algorithms used in the international robot soccer competition, RoboCup, used simple histogramming techniques targeted at a specific range of colour intensities to find a coloured ball on a green field. As the RoboCup playing field has become less structured over the years, competing teams have needed to account for unpredictable colours and have increasingly implemented methods that detect the shape of the ball as well. Schulz et al. \citet{schulz2007ball} used a neural network on subsampled luminance images of the ball to detect the shape of the ball. Recent approaches have focused on detecting the approximately circular shape of the ball in typical images. These include clustering, Hough filters \citep{li2013survey}, and RANSAC~\citep{annable2013nubots}.

		Many current ball detection methods make assumptions about the ball or the environment that limit their applicability in a more general case. Methods based on colour classification or similarity can suffer from false positive detections due to other objects having similar colours. These methods may also detect both false positives and false negatives due to unexpected changes in lighting. Methods based on circle or ellipse detection can be prone to false positives due to the presence of disk-like objects in the environment, or due to objects that appear circular when viewed from specific angles.

		To avoid the limitations of methods based on assumptions such as these, we developed a sphere detection method which uses the shading patterns characteristic of spherical objects to classify objects as spheres.

		Nillius et al. \citet{nillius2008shading} perform shading based sphere detection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a basis derived analytically from a given Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and assumptions on scene illumination. While this method works well for plain untextured spheres, it is
		not designed to work on spheres with patterns printed on them, like many soccer balls.

		To build a detector that is more robust to differently textured spheres, we investigated the application of techniques popularised in the realm of face detection to the task of sphere detection. We consider this a promising approach, because the 3D shading features of spheres tend to have similar spatial constraints to facial features in many cases. We assumed that the balls to be detected are resting on the ground and are illuminated from above to constrain the likely positions of shadows and specular highlights.


		% For simplicity, the scope of this work was limited to the common and important case of detecting balls that are resting on the ground. We also assumed that the sphere is illuminated primarily from above to constrain the likely positions of shadows and specular highlights.

		Masselli et al. \citet{masselli2013haar} successfully apply a boosted Haar classifier \citep{viola2001robust} to the problem of ball recognition. They show that the Haar classifier outperformed a more classical approach, based on a Hough transform, in the task of detecting uniformly yellow, green, and white balls.

		A similar approach	\citet{zhang2013novel} attempted to detect a wide variety of generic FIFA-style balls by using extended Haar features~\citep{Lienhart2002extended} as weak classifiers. Zhang et al. \citet{zhang2013novel} reported improved performance when modified Haar features that used a division operation between their area sums, instead of the usual subtraction, were included. This suggests that exploring alternate weak classifiers could lead to valuable performance improvements.

		Mitri et al. \citet{mitri2004fast} applied a Sobel filter and a threshold function to each image as preprocessing steps, passing only the detected edge images to the classifiers. The method learnt Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs) of Haar features instead of directly using Haar features as weak classifiers. Their system performed sufficiently well for ball tracking, but detected other round objects as false positives. It also performed significantly better when a more complex training dataset was applied, which included images under different lighting conditions and environments. We consider it likely that their poor false positive rate was a symptom of ignoring the shading information of the spheres by using only an edge image.

		Treptow and Zell \citet{treptow2004filter} achieved a much lower false positive rate using Haar features directly, but only trained and tested their detector on a single ball.

		As a result of targeting our approach toward the 3D features that distinguish 3-dimensional balls from objects such as disks, our method is expected to be particularly robust against detecting false positives.

	}

	\section{Training For Sphere Detection} {

		The aim of this study is to create a robust sphere detector that does not detect disk-like objects as false positives. To achieve this, we trained Viola-Jones detector cascades~\citep{viola2001rapid} using each of the following three different feature types: Extended Haar features~\citep{Lienhart2002extended}, Local Binary Patterns (LBPs)~\citep{liao2007learning}, and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HoG) features~\citep{dalal2005histograms}. We hypothesised that including a large proportion of disk-like negative images in the training set would increase the precision of the resulting sphere detectors.

%		To achieve this, we trained Viola-Jones detector cascades~\citep{viola2001rapid} using each of three different feature types. We tested our hypothesis on each of three commonly used, but different feature types. The feature types used were extended Haar features~\citep{Lienhart2002extended}, Local Binary Patterns (LBPs)~\citep{liao2007learning}, and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HoG) features~\citep{dalal2005histograms}.

%		The hypothesis was tested through the experiment outlined in Section~\ref{sec:experiment}.

	}

	\section{Experiment} {
	\label{sec:experiment}

		In order to test the hypothesis using the three chosen feature types, five training schemes were devised (Table~\ref{tab:training_schemes}).

    \todo{Add a table describing the training schemes used?}

    % TODO: Describe and implement one of the following training schemes:

    % Option 1: A scheme for testing each hypothesis:
    % 36 total trials in two schemes of 18 trials.
    %
    % # # Dataset for testing hardNegFrac hypothesis:
    % # number: { paramSet: ['6000'] }
    % # hardNegFrac: { paramSet: ['0.00', '0.2', '0.4', '0.6', '0.8', 1.0] }
    % # skipFrac: { paramSet: ['0.2'] }
    %
    % # # Dataset for testing classifier improvement due to number of samples:
    % # number: { paramSet: ['1000', '2000', '3000', '4000', '5000', '6000'] }
    % # hardNegFrac: { paramSet: ['0.2'] }
    % # skipFrac: { paramSet: ['0.2'] }

    % Option 2: A single scheme allowing both hypotheses to be tested:
    % 108 trials in a single training scheme.
    % this would allow contour plots to be created for each classifier type.
    %
    % # # Combined dataset for testing both hypotheses:
    % # number: { paramSet: ['1000', '2000', '3000', '4000', '5000', '6000'] }
    % # hardNegFrac: { paramSet: ['0.00', '0.2', '0.4', '0.6', '0.8', 1.0] }
    % # skipFrac: { paramSet: ['0.2'] } # Consider increasing to 0.25 for safety?
    % # posFrac: { paramSet: ['0.66'] }
    % # featureType: { paramSet: [HAAR, LBP, HOG] }

		% \end{table}

		Each training scheme specified the size and contents of the dataset, and the training parameters, used to train a classifier.
		The parameter values used in the training schemes were chosen both to test the hypothesis, and to explore the parameter space.
		Five parameters were chosen for the training schemes, and were defined as follows:

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{\textbf{Set size:}} Number of samples in the training set.
			\item{\textbf{Positive \%:}} The percentage of samples in the training set that are positive (i.e. that are images of spheres).
			\item{\textbf{Hard Negative \%:}} The percentage of negative samples in the training set that are \scarequotes{hard negatives} (i.e. they are images of disk-like objects, as opposed to miscellaneous background images).
			\item{\textbf{NumPos:}} The number of positive samples shown to each stage of the classifier cascade during training.
      \todo{Replace NumPos with skipFrac, and describe the alternate parameterisation}
			% \item{\textbf{Simple:}}
			% 	Thirteen categories of spheres were chosen from ImageNet \citep{imagenet_cvpr09}.
			% 	The full set of positive samples was drawn from these thirteen categories, listed in Table~\ref{tab:positive_samples}.
			% 	Due to the wide variation in appearance of the spheres in the set, it was considered possible that drawing training samples from the full set while training could cause the trained classifiers to fail to classify any category of sphere with reasonable precision, given the small set sizes used.
			% 	For this reason, a subset of the original thirteen sphere categories were used to create a \newterm{simple training set}.
			% 	The categories selected for the simple set were those that contained mostly images of plain, non-textured spheres, and are listed in Table~\ref{tab:positive_samples_simple}. The two datasets are described in Section~\ref{sec:dataset}.
			%
			% 	The \textbf{Simple} parameter describes whether the simple set of positive samples was used instead of the full set.
			%
			% 	Note that in designing the training schemes, the set size of each training schemes that used the simple training set were restricted to be lower than those that used the full training set, due to the far lesser number of images in the simple set.
		\end{enumerate}

		\subsection{Image Dataset Compilation} {
		\label{sec:dataset}
      ImageNet \citep{imagenet_cvpr09} is an image database organised according to the WordNet hierarchy \citep{fellbaum1998wordnet} that was used as a source of training and testing data. This resource offers a wide range of images along with associated class and bounding box information. The use of ImageNet has facilitated the collection of many more training samples than would be possible to collect manually within the time-frame of this project.

			Only images that contained bounding box information were extracted from ImageNet for use as positive training samples. Prior to training, each positive sample was cropped from its original image, using the provided bounding box information, before being	resized to \(24\times24\) pixels and converted to grayscale. An example of this process has been demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:samples}.

			Several WordNet categories (known as \newterm{synsets}) were used to compile the training and test set for this project. Table~\ref{tab:positive_samples} represents the positive samples used in the training set. The images for the negative training set were drawn from both the list of categories of disk-like objects in Table~\ref{tab:negative_samples}, and the list of categories of background images given in Table~\ref{tab:background_samples}.
      All \newterm{hyponyms} (synsets representing subcategories) of the listed synsets were also included in the dataset, except for those listed in Table~\ref{tab:blacklisted_synsets}, as the contained images of objects that were considered too far from either spheres or circles in shape.
      A randomly selected 20\% of the samples of each of the three sample sets was set aside for use as a test set before beginning training.
			% The test set comprised the categories listed in Table~\ref{tab:test_set}, along with the positive training set samples previously described in Table~\ref{tab:positive_samples}.

      \todo{

		% Several Haar cascade classifiers were trained on this datset, using different training parameters, and their performances compared qualatitively by viewing the claissifier output on a small set of test images.

		% The preliminary results obtained are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:results}.
		% These results show that the resulting quality of a classifier is extremely sensitive to the training data and settings used.
		% Some of the classifiers trained show promise, in that they detect balls in some of the images, and appear to detect circular objects in others, but it is clear that most of the supposed detections are false positives.
		% The authors suspect that there are two main reasons for the low classification performance:

		% \begin{itemize}
		% 	\item The set of positive examples is too small and too varied; and
		% 	\item The set of negative examples is poor, in that the images it contains are far too dissimilar from spheres.

	\section{Discussion} {

		% \todo{Interpret the results and determine whether the hypothesis was correct. Compare the results to other methods. Discuss any additional results not related to the controlled experiment (e.g. performance in practice, the best classifier attained, etc.)}

		% A clear trend is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:trial_comparison_chart_recall}, where the recall of the classifiers that used Haar features was much greater than those that used LBPs, which in turn had higher recall than the classifiers using HoG features.
		%
		% Figure~\ref{fig:trial_comparison_chart_precision} shows that the Haar classifiers almost always had higher precision than the classifiers using LBP features, although the difference in performance in schemes 3--5 may not be significant.
		% The classifiers using HoG features also generally had higher precision than those using LBP features, except in scheme~3.

		% Based on these observations, the results suggest that Haar features are more appropriate than LBP features for the sphere detection task, as the Haar classifiers had the same are better precision and recall for every training scheme.
		% We suggest that this may be because the differences of intensity of image regions used in Haar features allow them to better capture the low frequency features that distinguish spheres from disks, i.e. shading due to curvature, whereas LBP patterns mostly describe edges, corners, and points, and so more often classify other rounded objects as spheres.

    \todo{Discussion on the relative performance of the three classifier types, and the trend as the number of training samples increased.}

		We hypothesised that including a greater proportion of images of disk-like objects as negative samples in the training set would increase the precision of the resulting trained classifiers.
    \todo{Discussion on whether the data supports the hypothesis.}
    % To test the hypothesis, we compare the results of scheme~1 to scheme~2 and scheme~3, and also compare the results of scheme~4 to scheme~5, as these schemes are similar in most respects other than the hard negative proportion.
		%
		% Comparing schemes one and two, we see that the precision of all three classifier types is much higher when trained on scheme two. The recall rate of both the classifiers using Haar and LBP features, but not the classifier using HoG features.
		% This difference supports the hypothesis, since scheme~1 used no hard negatives, whereas 25\% of the negative samples in scheme~2 were hard negatives.
		% Comparing schemes one and three reveals the opposite result for classifiers using both Haar and HoG features, as these classifiers had lower recall rate and lower precision in scheme~3 than in scheme~1. We note that this difference must be due to the higher value of NumPos used in scheme~3.
		%
		% We now compare scheme~4 to scheme~5, as they were both trained on the full set of positive images. Scheme~5 included no hard negative samples in its training set, whereas 20\% of the negative samples in scheme~4 were hard negatives. Due to this, and the relatively low number of background images that were available before performing the experiment, scheme~5 has a smaller training set size of 3500 samples, compared to 4000 samples for scheme~4. Scheme~4 also used a higher NumPos parameter than scheme~5.
		% The precision of classifiers of all three feature types was higher in scheme~4 than in scheme~5, and the recall of each classifier was slightly lower in scheme~4 than in scheme~5.
		% This difference supports the hypothesis, and is similar to the difference between the results of schemes one and two. However, the additional changes in the set size and in NumPos make this comparison weaker evidence for the hypothesis than the comparison between schemes one and two.

		The live classification performance of one of the best performing classifiers from the experiment, \(haar_4\), was tested to qualitatively evaluate the quality of the training process.
		This test involved the use of a HD webcam to perform live object detection. The webcam was presented with a number of balls with the intention of observing the robustness of the trained sphere detector.
		This experiment appeared to perform quite well and detected most of the balls in the scene. The sphere detector, however, did not perform well when presented with a highly textured ball as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:fifa_ball}.

		It was also noted that the detector could not detect the balls when the webcam was significantly rotated such that the ball was upside down with respect to the camera. This effect is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:rotated_sequence}. This supports the suggestion that the detectors using Haar features perform shading based detection and not simply circle detection.

		\todo{re-run the live classification test}

		%\newpage

		% \todo{note that there is no clear relationship between the number of images used and precision}

% These results indicate that Haar feature-types performed better than HOGS or LBP due to the overall higher precision and recall rate. However, it is clear from this data that HOG has a high precision rate that matches closely to HAAR features. It is interesting to note that using the simple positive training set resulted in a lower rate of recall.

	\section{Conclusion} {
	\label{sec:conclusion}

		% \todo{Haar features performed better than HOGS or LBP. LBP features performed better than HOGS. Increasing the proportion of negative images decreased the hit rate.}

		This paper approached the problem of sphere detection using boosted classifiers.
		We hypothesised that including a larger proportion of disk-like images as negative samples in the training set would increase the precision of the resulting sphere detectors.
		The hypothesis was tested in a controlled experiment that compared the appropriateness of three different feature types to the problem: extended Haar features, LBPs, and HoGs.

		\todo{Rewrite sumary of results after completing experiments:}
		\todo{The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis, but further testing would be required to have a high confidence that the increase in precision identified can be attributed to the increase in the proportion of disk-like negative images in the training set.
		Additionally, our results suggested that Haar features are better suited to the problem of sphere detection than LBPs.}

		In our future work, we plan to repeat the experiment described in this paper with a greater number and variety of training schemes. We also plan to experiment with image preprocessing techniques, to investigate the effect they have on the precision of our sphere detector. These preprocessing techniques should be applied to both the positive and negative samples prior to training and upon classification. We will consider histogram equalisation, gamma intensity correction and high and low pass filtering \citep{gross2003image} as preprocessing techniques in our future work.
